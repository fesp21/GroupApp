I looked at the Tubedit webapp. I think the Like and Dislike feature is very cool, even though I think the idea came from Facebook. The option to Dislike makes it more fun though. By looking at the code, I think Like and Dislike buttons are basically a link to the edit page of the move object, and from there we can update the counter attribute by clicking Like or Dislike. It would be much nicer if I can Like with just one single click to the Like button, instead of having to go to edit page to Like it.
