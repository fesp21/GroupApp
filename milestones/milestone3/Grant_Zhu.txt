I looked at the debate website and I like how it links up the pros and cons arguments so that you can easily see and get a gist of what the argument is. I assume it will be an interesting place to settle internet arguments in a public forum. Currently there was only one debate going on and the app crashed and became offline as I was browsing it so I couldn't see the other features.
