I looked at the foodrun website. The grocery list feature is perhaps the most interesting part of the website. Essentially, it automatically compiles a list of groceries needed to buy based on the recipes added to the recipe list by the user. Unfortunately, at the time of viewing this feature on their heroku website, the grocery list remains static regardless of the recipes added to the recipe list. However, when this feature is actually implemented correctly, it will be a unique factor for this application that I have not seen in other recipe websites.
