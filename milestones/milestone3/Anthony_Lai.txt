I looked into the white-board team's project, and the feature that I liked
was how multiple users on the site could collaborate on the same project
and draw on the same "whiteboard" at the same time (in theory). I ran into
some trouble regarding clicking on a layer other than the base layers making the layer bar on the left nonfunctional, so they could improve on that.
