I've looked into the beatmap team's project, and the feature that I 
particularly liked was mapping restaurants and other shops on a google 
map not only on location, but also with a indicator, using a red dot 
with varying degrees of concentration, to indicate what places are more 
popular. One thing they can improve on though, is to scale this red dot 
acoording to google map's zoom level.
